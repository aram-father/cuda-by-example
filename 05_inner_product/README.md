## What does it do?

- Generate two float arrays with length of LEN

- Calculate inner product of the generated arrays using **CPU** and measure the execution time

- Calculate inner product of the generated arrays using **GPU** and measure the execution time

- Print the result of each inner product and its execution time

## Usage

```bash
./05_inner_product 1048576
# Expected output
# CPU Result: 1.000
# CPU Execution Time: 1000.000 msec
# GPU Result: 1.000
# GPU Execution Time: 100.000 msec
